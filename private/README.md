# Private

The private service/database is meant to hold data that is needed by the system,
but shouldn't be generally available to the public, (though there is no actual
private information here.

The following graphs are currently private:

http://experts.ucdavis.edu/private/grant/ - VIVO defined grants, complete for
the whole UCD.

http://experts.ucdavis.edu/private/person/ - VIVO defined persons, all staff for
UCD.  This is the IAM information only.

The private service is defined w/ a union graph and should work fine for that as
well.
