** Academic Title Codes and Concepts Organization

For Academic titles, the [[https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/compensation/academic-ctos-titles-and-title-codes/index.html][Academic Personnel and Programs]] page includes
information you need about the titles and codes for Academic. I retrieved this
page on 2021-02-08 and converted that to a CSV file.  Vessela received an email
from Brian Darnell, on Feb 9th, that includes the CTO codes that are in the
senate and the federation.  Alainna Wrigley sent us the UCOP complete list of
Title Codes on 2021-02-16, this includes all codes, not just title codes.
Vessela forwarded a list of CTO codes (On Feb 5th).  This includes whether they
are active or not. This is currently not included.

[[https://academicaffairs.ucdavis.edu/academic-federation][Academic Federation]] has some information, but these are in terms of title series
codes, and how do they compare to title codes?

All of these were combined in a single spreadsheet, better to communicate the
issues with other agencies.
